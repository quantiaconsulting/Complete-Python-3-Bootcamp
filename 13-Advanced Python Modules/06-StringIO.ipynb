    "Back in **Lecture 24 - Files** we opened files that exist outside of python, and streamed their contents into an in-memory file object. You can also create in-memory file-like objects within your program that Python treats the same way. Text data is stored in a StringIO object, while binary data would be stored in a BytesIO object. This object can then be used as input or output to most functions that would expect a standard file object.\n",
